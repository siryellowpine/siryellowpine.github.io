    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I created this blog to share my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge without limitation, and I update it every week with carefully selected topics that matter to me. My aim is to provide a space where ideas can be expressed freely and explored in depth.</p>
    <p>I am 21 years old, based in the world, and work as a Chartering Broker in the dry bulk shipping market. My professional focus is on maritime trade, freight markets, and strategic negotiation, areas in which I have built both expertise and passion.</p>
    <p>I am accessible at all times and welcome meaningful conversations, professional connections, and collaborations. For direct contact, you can reach me at:<br>
