Dear readers and colleagues,
I would like to share with you an issue that has been occupying my mind intensely in recent times, within the framework of my own analysis and evaluation. Throughout my nearly three years of professional experience in the maritime industry, I have had the opportunity to closely observe the dynamics, strengths, and ethical challenges of this sector.

I am aware that many of you have far more years of experience in this field than I do. However, instead of postponing these thoughts that have long been on my mind, I have chosen to share them here, in this blog I have established to contribute to our industry and to exchange my ideas, views, and experiences with our sector’s stakeholders.

One of the most fragile aspects of our sector is the abuse of the trust that brokers are sometimes entrusted with. In theory, a broker should act as a stabilizing force between the parties, like a fender that both sides can lean on with confidence. In practice, however, it is regrettable that things do not always work this way.

For example, providing false information to one party for the benefit of the other, or knowingly withholding the truth, is one of the most dangerous deviations in this profession. This can take the form of an outright lie or concealing the truth by remaining silent. Practices such as applying a freight difference may yield short-term personal gain, but in the long run they erode trust and damage the overall reputation of the sector.

Similarly, actions such as “applying a freight difference” to manipulate market values and create an unfair distribution of gains between parties weaken not only individual but also institutional relationships. Such behavior quickly depletes a broker’s most valuable asset, which is trust.

In conclusion, brokering in the maritime industry is not merely about connecting ships and cargoes; it is a profession built on trust, reputation, and transparency. Prices change, markets fluctuate, ships come and go from one voyage to another, but your name is the most lasting trace you will leave behind in every deal you make.

Deviating from the ethical line may seem tempting in the short term. However, those who endure in this sector in the long term are always the ones who build trust. Because one day, a shipowner or charterer on the other side of the world will hear about you before they meet you, and at that moment, the only thing that will make you their preferred choice will be honesty.

Since the very first day I entered this profession, I have adopted the following principle: being a bridge between the parties is only possible by keeping the foundations of that bridge strong. What makes this foundation strong is solely honesty, transparency, and mutual respect. I hope that every colleague who reads this will consciously choose between short-term gain and long-term reputation when determining their own stance.
