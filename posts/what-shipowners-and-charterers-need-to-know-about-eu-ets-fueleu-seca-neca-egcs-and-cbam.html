          <h2 class="title">What Shipowners and Charterers Need to Know about EU ETS, FuelEU, SECA, NECA, EGCS and CBAM</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="post-body">
          <p>Dear readers &amp; colleagues, in recent years many different sectors have seen wave after wave of new emissions rules. Despite hundreds of seminars, conferences, and webinars from agencies, associations, foundations, and companies, adapting to fast and deep changes has been challenging for me too.</p>

<p>I prepared this short guide both as a memory aid for myself and to share with you. The focus is narrow by design. Only what shipowners and charterers need to know, explained in the simplest possible way and in a conversational style. If you have questions or feedback, you can reach me any time through the contact information in the About section of my blog.</p>

<p>++++</p>

<p>1) EU ETS for shipping</p>

<p>By whom<br>
European Commission and national administering authorities, with EMSA’s THETIS MRV and the Union Registry used for reporting and surrender.</p>

<p>To whom<br>
The shipping company that holds ISM and the Document of Compliance. Costs can be allocated by contract, but the regulated entity remains the company.</p>

<p>Why<br>
To price greenhouse gas emissions from ships and drive reductions. From 2026 methane and nitrous oxide are included in addition to carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>How<br>
Coverage rules are simple. EEA to EEA legs count 100 percent. EEA to a third country legs count 50 percent. Port area and at berth emissions count 100 percent. Timeline each year is verified report by 31 March through THETIS MRV, Document of Compliance on board by 30 June, EUA surrender by 30 September. Phase in is 40 percent for 2024, 70 percent for 2025, and 100 percent from 2026.</p>

<p>Since when<br>
From 1 January 2024 emissions.</p>

<p>Until when<br>
Ongoing subject to periodic review.</p>

<p>Formula if applicable<br>
EUA ≈ fuel in tons × emission factor in tCO₂ per ton × geographic share 100 or 50 × year share 40 or 70 or 100.<br>
Cost ≈ EUA × EUA price in euro. Quick factors often used: HFO or VLSFO about 3.114 and MGO about 3.206 tCO₂ per ton.</p>

<p>What matters to charterers<br>
Put the coverage rule, the year share, and the pricing reference EEX or ICE into the fixture. Speed, route, and fuel decisions move the EUA invoice line for line.</p>

<p>What matters to shipowners<br>
Open a MOHA in the Union Registry, run the THETIS MRV routine, and plan cash and procurement so the 30 September surrender is never late. Non compliance is 100 euro per excess ton plus the obligation to surrender remains.</p>

<p>++++</p>

<p>2) FuelEU Maritime</p>

<p>By whom<br>
European Union.</p>

<p>To whom<br>
Ships of 5,000 GT and above calling at EEA ports subject to listed exemptions.</p>

<p>Why<br>
To reduce the well to wake greenhouse gas intensity of the energy used on board. The 2020 fleet average reference is 91.16 gCO₂e per MJ. The 2025 target starts at minus two percent and the stringency increases over time.</p>

<p>How<br>
For fossil fuels you must use the regulation’s default tables. For sustainable and electrofuels you may apply a real GHG value when backed by PoS or PoC from an EU recognised voluntary scheme. Non compliance leads to monetary penalties and, for persistent cases, operational restrictions.</p>

<p>Since when<br>
From 1 January 2025.</p>

<p>Until when<br>
Pathway to 2050 with about 80 percent reduction versus the reference.</p>

<p>Formula if applicable<br>
Annual average GHG intensity equals the sum of each energy share multiplied by the fuel’s gCO₂e per MJ. Keep the result below the annual target. Use default values for fossil fuels or real values with PoS or PoC.</p>

<p>What matters to charterers<br>
Fuel choice changes the score. Ask suppliers for PoS or PoC as a standard document set.</p>

<p>What matters to shipowners<br>
Add the calculation method to the Monitoring Plan, collect evidence, and manage the yearly average against the target.</p>

<p>++++</p>

<p>3) SOx sulphur limits and SECAs</p>

<p>By whom<br>
IMO MARPOL Annex VI. In the EU there is also a separate at berth rule.</p>

<p>To whom<br>
All ships regardless of flag.</p>

<p>Why<br>
Air quality and health protection.</p>

<p>How<br>
Global cap is 0.50 percent sulphur since 2020. In SECAs the limit is 0.10 percent or an approved EGCS equivalence. The Mediterranean has been a SECA since 1 May 2025. In EU ports at berth the limit is 0.10 percent and this has applied since 2010.</p>

<p>Since when<br>
Global 0.50 from 2020, Mediterranean SECA from 1 May 2025, EU at berth 0.10 from 2010.</p>

<p>Until when<br>
Open ended with possible regional updates.</p>

<p>Formula if applicable<br>
No numeric formula. You either use compliant sulphur fuel or achieve an equivalent result with an EGCS.</p>

<p>What matters to charterers<br>
If a leg sits inside a SECA, specify the fuel or scrubber plan and cost in advance. Remember EU at berth is always 0.10.</p>

<p>What matters to shipowners<br>
Keep bunker delivery notes and samples straight. If you rely on EGCS, track port specific restrictions carefully.</p>

<p>++++</p>

<p>4) NOx limits and NECAs</p>

<p>By whom<br>
IMO MARPOL Annex VI Regulation 13.</p>

<p>To whom<br>
Marine diesel engines of 130 kW and above.</p>

<p>Why<br>
To cut nitrogen oxides that drive smog and ozone.</p>

<p>How<br>
Tier III applies only inside NOx ECAs and only to new engines. North America and US Caribbean from 1 January 2016. Baltic and North Sea from 1 January 2021. Compliance is typically via SCR, EGR, or a combination.</p>

<p>Since when<br>
As above for each NECA.</p>

<p>Until when<br>
Open ended and more NECAs may be designated.</p>

<p>Formula if applicable<br>
No cost formula. Compliance is shown with EIAPP and the NOx Technical File and measured against the Tier III limit.</p>

<p>What matters to charterers<br>
On trades that sit inside a NECA, confirm Tier III capability and any retrofit implications.</p>

<p>What matters to shipowners<br>
Plan Tier III for newbuilds and check SCR or EGR retrofit feasibility for existing tonnage.</p>

<p>++++</p>

<p>5) CBAM carbon border adjustment</p>

<p>By whom<br>
European Commission and national authorities. Processes run through the CBAM Registry.</p>

<p>To whom<br>
The authorised CBAM declarant that imports CBAM goods into the EU. From 1 January 2026 only authorised declarants may import covered goods.</p>

<p>Why<br>
To prevent carbon leakage and align the carbon cost of imports with EU production. The CBAM certificate price mirrors the weekly average of EUA auction results. Carbon prices effectively paid in the country of origin can be deducted.</p>

<p>How<br>
Transitional period from 1 October 2023 to 31 December 2025 with quarterly reporting and no payment. Definitive period from 1 January 2026 with purchase of CBAM certificates and an annual declaration and surrender cycle. The first surrender occurs in 2027 for the previous year.</p>

<p>Since when<br>
Reporting since October 2023. Payment from January 2026.</p>

<p>Until when<br>
Open ended. Scope is reviewed and may expand.</p>

<p>Formula if applicable<br>
CBAM cost ≈ embedded emissions in tCO₂e × CBAM price in euro per ton minus any carbon price effectively paid abroad.</p>

<p>What matters to charterers<br>
You only have a direct CBAM duty if you are also the importer. Otherwise you may see data requests and pass through costs in contracts. Define data and cost sharing in your agreements.</p>

<p>What matters to shipowners<br>
You are not the CBAM payer, but cargo interests may ask for plant or product emissions evidence to support their filings. Keep records aligned with supplier data.</p>

<p>++++</p>

<p>6) EGCS wash water restrictions in OSPAR waters</p>

<p>By whom<br>
OSPAR Commission with national implementation by the contracting parties.</p>

<p>To whom<br>
Ships in coastal and inland waters within the OSPAR area.</p>

<p>Why<br>
To limit pollutants and acidity in receiving waters.</p>

<p>How<br>
Open loop discharges are to be prohibited from 1 July 2027. All EGCS discharges are to be prohibited from 1 July 2029 in those waters. Countries may allow deferrals of up to three years. Offshore waters and areas outside OSPAR follow local rules.</p>

<p>Since when<br>
Decision adopted in 2025 with the above start dates.</p>

<p>Until when<br>
As long as national rules remain in force.</p>

<p>Formula if applicable<br>
No formula. It is a discharge prohibition.</p>

<p>What matters to charterers<br>
If your trade spends time in OSPAR ports and rivers, HSFO with scrubber may not be practical. Budget for fuel switching.</p>

<p>What matters to shipowners<br>
Recheck the business case for scrubbers route by route. Even closed loop will face bans in port and inland waters on the stated dates.</p>

<p>++++</p>

<p>7) Polar HFO bans</p>

<p>By whom<br>
IMO MARPOL.</p>

<p>To whom<br>
Ships operating in polar waters.</p>

<p>Why<br>
To reduce spill risk and black carbon impacts.</p>

<p>How<br>
In the Arctic the use and carriage of HFO is banned from 1 July 2024 with exemptions and waivers that can extend some uses until 2029. In Antarctica HFO has long been banned.</p>

<p>Since when<br>
Arctic ban from July 2024 and Antarctic ban since 2011.</p>

<p>Until when<br>
After exemptions expire, a full ban applies.</p>

<p>Formula if applicable<br>
No formula. It is a fuel ban.</p>

<p>What matters to charterers<br>
Plan compliant distillate or very low sulphur fuel availability and pricing for polar legs.</p>

<p>What matters to shipowners<br>
Align tank configuration and bunker planning with polar rules.</p>

<p>One view on which fuel where<br>
Inside SECAs in the Baltic, the North Sea, North America, the US Caribbean, and the Mediterranean use 0.10 percent sulphur fuel such as ULSFO or MGO or use an approved scrubber.</p>

<p>Outside SECAs use 0.50 percent sulphur or lower fuel or use a scrubber.<br>
At berth in EU ports always use 0.10 percent sulphur.</p>

<p>++++</p>

<p>Mini Glossary</p>

<p>EUA: One ton of CO₂e allowance in the EU ETS.</p>

<p>EU ETS: EU carbon market. Shipping is in from 2024 emissions. Surrender is 30 September. Phase in is 40 then 70 then 100.</p>

<p>CBAM: EU carbon border adjustment for selected imported goods. Price follows the weekly average of EUA auctions. Ship fuel is not part of CBAM.</p>

<p>FuelEU Maritime: EU rule that reduces the GHG intensity of onboard energy measured in gCO₂e per MJ on a well to wake basis. Reference 91.16 and 2025 target minus two percent.</p>

<p>GHG intensity: CO₂e per unit of energy. For fossil fuels use default tables. For sustainable or electrofuels use PoS or PoC to apply a real value.</p>

<p>PoS and PoC: Proof of Sustainability and Proof of Compliance under EU recognised voluntary schemes.</p>

<p>ECA, SECA, NECA: Emission control areas. SECA is 0.10 sulphur. NECA requires Tier III on new engines. The Mediterranean is a SECA since 1 May 2025.</p>

<p>SOx and NOx: SOx is about what you burn. NOx is about how you burn it.</p>

<p>Tier I, II, III: Engine NOx levels. Tier III applies to new engines in NECAs. North America and US Caribbean since 2016. Baltic and North Sea since 2021.</p>

<p>EGCS or scrubber: Removes SOx but does not reduce CO₂.</p>

<p>OSPAR: North East Atlantic region. From 2027 open loop and from 2029 all EGCS discharges are to be banned in port and inland waters with possible deferrals.</p>

<p>EMSA and THETIS MRV: EU operational backbone for MRV and ETS.</p>

<p>MOHA: Maritime Operator Holding Account in the Union Registry.</p>
