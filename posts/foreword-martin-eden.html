          <p>In this novel Jack London invites us into America’s “Gilded Age” an era at the beginning of the 20th century when the gap between social classes and income levels had become more pronounced. Martin Eden tells the life story of a young inexperienced sailor from the working class only twenty years old.

No specific date is given for the time in which the novel takes place. However considering that the work was first published in 1908 and given the recurring themes of individualism class division cultural elitism and criticism of capitalism throughout the narrative it is assumed that the story is set in America during the 1890s to early 1900s. In this regard the novel strikingly reflects the social and economic realities of the mentioned period.

Dear readers as you witness the transformations in Martin’s life his inner conflicts and the events he will face I believe the novel’s multi-layered structure will draw you in as well. While reading you may find parallels with your own life and perhaps like me you may find yourself thinking “In fact we are all Martin Eden.”

This work masterfully touches on the depths of the human condition and carries a piece of nearly everyone’s life within it. It has been written without the slightest compromise from life. It should also be known that Martin Eden is not merely a fictional character but a literary reflection of Jack London’s individualist side. Martin’s class origin his fighting spirit his inner search and his tragic loneliness all carry traces directly from the author’s own life.

Through this novel London questioned not only individualism but also his own past and intellectual transformation.

As always I respectfully salute Jack London who once again remains faithful to the principles of social realism and naturalism in this novel.</p>
