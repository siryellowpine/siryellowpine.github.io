Dear Readers, forest fires are much older than humanity. They have always been part of nature’s cycle, but in the modern era we can finally measure them, record them, and compare them. That is the real difference.

Today we rely on two main sources of information. The first is EFFIS, the European Forest Fire Information System, created in 1998 by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. It not only collects data from that year onwards but also integrates past information, so we can trace Europe’s fire history back to the 1980s.
The second is GWIS, the Global Wildfire Information System, launched in 2015 as a joint effort between the European Commission and the United Nations. It uses NASA satellite data from MODIS and VIIRS. Consistent global records start in 2012. This is why international comparisons usually focus on the years between 2012 and 2025. It does not mean there were no fires before. It simply reflects the limits of the available data.

The trends are clear. In Europe, burned areas since the 1980s fluctuate. Some years show extremely high levels, others are relatively low, but in the long run the curve points upward. Globally, the same picture emerges. Since 2012, millions of hectares of land have burned.

What is most striking is that even when the total burned area goes down in some years, the carbon emissions from fires do not decrease. On the contrary, they rise. This is because fires are now happening in more fragile ecosystems and in denser forests. A smaller burned surface can release more carbon and cause greater ecological and atmospheric damage.

There are debates about the reliability of these numbers. Some researchers suggest that NASA’s MODIS satellites underestimate burned areas due to resolution limits. Others argue that human land management explains the decline in some regions. But almost everyone agrees on one point. Fires in dense ecosystems release more carbon, which explains why emissions continue to increase.

So the picture is clear. Fires will continue to exist. But their impact on ecosystems and on the climate is becoming far more destructive than in the past.

In response, the world is taking action. NASA and ESA satellites now provide near real time fire tracking with higher resolution than ever. Artificial intelligence is being used to predict risks by combining weather data with vegetation maps. Drones are deployed in Canada, Australia and the United States to monitor forests during fire seasons. The European Union has launched RescEU, a shared firefighting fleet to support member states when their own resources are insufficient.

On the ground, new approaches are being tested. In some countries drones scatter seeds to accelerate reforestation after large fires. Smart sensors placed in forests can detect smoke and heat at very early stages, allowing rapid intervention. The focus is shifting from only extinguishing fires to preventing them and reducing their ecological and climate impact.

The conclusion is simple. Fires are a natural part of our planet, but today their scale and consequences are global. Humanity is trying to answer with global tools, smarter technology, and shared strategies to cope with a challenge that belongs to all of us.
